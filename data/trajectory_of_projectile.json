      "question": "What role does friction play in a projectileâ€™s trajectory?",
      "options": [
        "Friction increases the speed of the projectile",
        "Friction has no effect on trajectory",
        "Friction provides an upward force",
        "Friction acts against motion, reducing range and height"

      "question": "How does the formula for projectile motion change when friction is removed?",
      "options": [
        "The motion becomes circular",
        "The motion becomes irregular and unpredictable",
        "The standard equations of motion under constant acceleration apply without air resistance",
